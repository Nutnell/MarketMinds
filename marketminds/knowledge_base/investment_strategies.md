# Core Investment Philosophies

## Value Investing
Value investing is an investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value. Value investors actively seek out stocks they believe the market is undervaluing. They believe the market overreacts to good and bad news, resulting in stock price movements that do not correspond to a company's long-term fundamentals. The primary architects of value investing are Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. Warren Buffett, Graham's most famous student, is the most famous living value investor.

## Growth Investing
Growth investing is a stock-buying strategy that aims to profit from companies that are growing at an above-average rate compared to other companies in the market. Growth investors typically focus on young or small companies whose earnings are expected to increase at a higher rate than the average company. These companies often reinvest their earnings back into the business to fuel further growth, rather than paying out dividends. Technology and biotech sectors are common hunting grounds for growth investors.

## Index Fund Investing
Index fund investing is a form of passive investing where a portfolio of stocks or bonds is designed to mimic the composition and performance of a financial market index, such as the S&P 500. It offers broad market exposure, low operating expenses, and low portfolio turnover. This strategy is famously advocated by John Bogle, founder of Vanguard. It is a long-term strategy that relies on the overall growth of the market rather than picking individual winning stocks.
