## Value Investing
Value investing is an investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value. Value investors actively seek out stocks they believe the market is undervaluing. They believe the market overreacts to good and bad news, resulting in stock price movements that do not correspond to a company's long-term fundamentals. The primary architects of value investing are Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. Warren Buffett, Graham's most famous student, is the most famous living value investor.
